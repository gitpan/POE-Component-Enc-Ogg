POE/Component/Enc/Ogg version 1.04
==================================

This is a POE component for wrapping the Ogg Vorbis encoder 'oggenc'

POE is a multitasking framework for Perl. Ogg Vorbis is an open standard for
compressed audio and oggenc is an encoder for this standard. This module wraps
oggenc into the POE framework, simplifying its use in, for example, a CD music
ripper and encoder application. It provides an object oriented interface.

To use this module, you will need the POE framework (See http://poe.perl.org/)
and you will need to install the OggVorbis tools (See http://www.vorbis.com/).
For encoding from flac files, you will also need the Free Lossless Audio Codec
tool (See http://flac.sourceforge.net/).
